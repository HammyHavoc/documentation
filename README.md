# Documentation hub

Documentation hub for links to open source documentation in the DIY diabetes ecosystem

### TODO:
* Create master list of content - categories, links to each open source project
* Consider using an open source tool to allow people to select equipment and see applicable open source projects, such as use-adapt ([webpage example here](https://use-adapt.github.io/), [source here](https://github.com/use-adapt/adapt)).

### Draft categories based on 26 May 18 discussion:
* APS algo
* Glucose Source
